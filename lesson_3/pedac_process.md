### Tic Tac Toe Attack Square

Algorithm:
If the computer has markers in 2 squares and the 3rd is empty, mark that square

If not, check if the player has markers in 2 squares. If it does, and the 3rd is
empty, mark that square

if neither of these are possible, check square 5. If it's empty, mark it

If the computer has markers on at least 1 square, and the player has no markers
on the other squares, mark a square
